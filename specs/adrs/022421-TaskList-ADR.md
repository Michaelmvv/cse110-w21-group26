# How Task List should work and what implementations

* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [Everyone] <!-- optional -->
* Date: [2021-02-24] Updated: [2021-03-07]<!-- optional -->

Technical Story: [We need to know how exactly our task list will work] <!-- optional -->

## Updated Decision

* Instead of having a pop modal to insert the task, implement a input type so allow for more name changes consistently. In this, when adding a new task, it adds a default task with the text "Enter Task".

## Context and Problem Statement

[We know we want a task list as a feature but how should it be implemented. What buttons/features do we want for it]

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* [We need a simple and intuitive design]
* [We need a to-do list as well as a done list]
* [We need a way to organize the list and change order]

## Considered Options

* [We need a way to organize the list and change order]
* [Should we have a flexible pomo session counter]
* [Should we have two separate lists to still in work and done]

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[We will have a list that keeps track of number of pomo sessions. We will have a completed and a still-to-do list. We will have an option to change ordering.]"

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* We are giving the most optimal features that a user can use

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* We don't have a method of explaining the functionality to the user
