* Deciders: [Weekly Meeting (everyone)] <!-- optional -->
* Date: [2021-02-03 when the decision was last updated] <!-- optional -->

Technical Story: [How to keep track of our progress] <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

[We need a more official way to keep track of progress and documentation of artifacts and checkpoints. When we do a task related to the project, we need to have a place to put deliverables and show that the task has been completed.]

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* [All on Slack will be hard to keep track of]
* [We want to simulate how real companies will work and their setting on managing progress on tasks]
* … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

* [Figma]
* [GitHub Actions]
* [Tools that Professor has mentioned]
* [Integrate Stand-up with Slack]
* … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

[We choose options 1,2, and 4. Figma allows design to be made in a very nice and easy to use website. GitHub Actions allows all project-related information to be in one place. Daily stand-up on Slack reduces different accounts need to be made].
