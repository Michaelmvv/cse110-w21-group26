# [Progress Tracker - tools to help the process]

* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [Weekly Meeting (everyone)] <!-- optional -->
* Date: [2021-02-03 when the decision was last updated] <!-- optional -->

Technical Story: [How to keep track of our progress] <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

[We need a more official way to keep track of progress and documentation of artifacts and checkpoints. When we do a task related to the project, we need to have a place to put deliverables and show that the task has been completed.]

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* [All on Slack will be hard to keep track of]
* [We want to simulate how real companies will work and their setting on managing progress on tasks]
* … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

* [Figma]
* [GitHub Actions and Sprint Board on Github]
* [Tools that Professor has mentioned]
* [Integrate Daily Stand-up with Slack]
* … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

[We choose options 1,2, and 4. Figma allows design to be made in a very nice and easy to use website. GitHub Actions allows all project-related information to be in one place and we can easily visualize which tasks are on the backlog, ready for work, in progress, blocked, need human checking, and which tasks are done. Daily stand-up on Slack reduces different accounts needed to be made and prompts a reminder to all members to communicate their progress or blockers].

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Increased communication between members.
* Organized place to put deliverables.
* Sprint board helps visualize progress.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
* Takes time to learn how to navigate Figma for new members of our team.

* None that we can think of.
