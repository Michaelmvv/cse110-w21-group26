## Things to Discuss
- Do we want Pomodoro Timer to be
  - Automatic?
    - Timer automatically moves on to short/long breaks accordingly after 25-minute Pomodoro session ends
  - Manual?
    - Users manually select Pomodoro session, short break, or long break
  - Both?
    - Automatic Timer for when they add tasks(?)
    - Manual Timer if they don't want to add tasks(?)

- Do we want different color themes rather than only light/dark?
- Dropdown vs pop-up windows
- How do we want tasks to be added?
