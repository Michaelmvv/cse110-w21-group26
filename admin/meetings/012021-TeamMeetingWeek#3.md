Group Dream Idea: <br />
Parth - All Below <br />
Michael - Option Menu to enable features (Ex. list/to-do list), Different Themes, default settings with already set timer <br />
Andrew - Doesn't break flow, can be "hidden"/Go into the background. (Different) Ring  when it's done. <br />
Laurence - To-Do List to select what task you are working on. <br />
Lori - List Functionality (Either random or ordered), Start Button, Alert <br />
Emily - Focus on the functionality rather than personalized options, customized ring tones, having a to-do list=stress? <br />
Sally - Simple/Straight-forward, "no need for instructions", To-Do list with number of sessions, summary at end of the session. <br />
Kim - Simple and easy, No instructions manual <br />
Ronak - Big font size (as a default), simplistic approach <br />
