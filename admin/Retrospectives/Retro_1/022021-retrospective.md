Sprint Retro 1 <br />
Meeting Notes <br />
<br />
1. What did we think about how the sprint went?

  * Work was being accomplished but did not feel like a sprint environment
  * Didn't really use the CI/CD Pipeline as much as we should have
  * There wasn't much communication between the sub teams such as design and development.
  * We were not updating the GitHub project as much as we needed to. Need check up on progress.
  * Time management is getting harder and harder - Need to find time where most people of the group and work simultaneously.
  * We did not have clear organizational/logistics skills that were able to create update checks
<br />
2. How can we improve for the next sprint?

  * We need to set official goals for ourselves so we can feel more in the MVP Sprint environment
  * we will create one main channel instead of two separate ones so facilitate communication better.
  * We need to stick to our GitHub Protocols.
  * Have more group coding sessions between development and design team.

<br />
3. What was the reason we did not perform as well as we hoped we would?
  * We did not know what the environment felt like
  * We are having pressure on grading against what other teams have
  * We were not using the tools we had implemented
