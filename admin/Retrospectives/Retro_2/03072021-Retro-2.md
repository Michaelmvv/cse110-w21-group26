Sprint Retro 2 <br />
Meeting Notes <br />
<br />
1. What did we think about how the sprint went?

  * Work was being accomplished
  * We did use the CI/CD Pipeline effectively
  * Combining the sub-teams back into one main worked very well
  * Having Tasks List in Slack worked well
  * Having weekend coding sessions helped in time management
<br />
2. How can we improve for the next sprint?

  * Use the GitHub Project Board more rather than communicating in Slack
  * Still need a better way to communicate progress (more than just the Project Board)
  * Have a set number of tasks needing to be fixed in a coding session

<br />
3. What was the reason we did not perform as well as we hoped we would?

  * We still don't know how we are getting graded
  * We had some prolonged meetings that were not productive
  * We only had weekly coding sessions so if something was being blocked, we would have to wait a whole week for it.
  * Time management with different schedule.
